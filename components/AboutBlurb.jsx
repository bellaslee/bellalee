      <h2>Hi! I'm Bella.</h2>
      <p>
        I am a first-year student at the University of Washington intending on
        majoring in Informatics. My dream is to
        work in the intersection between visual communication and technology;
        lately, I've become very interested in creative coding. I hope to make
        information more accessible, intuitive, and enjoyable to consume through
        my work.

        I am the Chief Design Officer for Smirk UW and am currently working on
        Design and Web Development in the{' '}

        In my own time, I like to create illustrations of my favorite
        characters, play fingerstyle guitar, and get engrossed in my latest
        interest &#40;right now, I want to learn p5.js&#41;. If Iâ€™m not on
        campus, you can most likely find me at my favorite restaurant, Meesum
        Pastry, indulging in the nostalgic and comforting taste of Taiwanese
        cuisine.
