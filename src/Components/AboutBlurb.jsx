      <h2>Hi! I'm Bella.</h2>
      <p>
        I am a first-year student at the University of Washington intending on
        majoring in Informatics. I started out 100% sure I wanted to be a
        graphic designer, but I unexpectedly fell in love with web programming
        instead. Now, I strive to bridge the worlds between visual communication
        and technology. If I’m able to make even one person’s life easier or
        more enjoyable through my creations, then I can be satisfied.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m currently working on UX Design, Back-End Development, and Web
        Development for the Stoma Project in the Sensors, Energy, and Automation
        Laboratory, as well as Graphic Design for @smirk_uw on Instagram.

        In my own time, I like to create illustrations of my favorite
        characters, record covers of my favorite songs, and dance in my room as
        I play my favorite playlist through my Bluetooth speaker. If I’m not on
        campus, you can most definitely find me at my favorite restaurant,
        Meesum Pastry, indulging in the nostalgic and comforting taste of
        Taiwanese cuisine.
