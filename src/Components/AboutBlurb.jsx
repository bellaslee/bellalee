      <h2>Hi! I'm Bella.</h2>
      <p>
        I am a first-year student at the University of Washington intending on
        majoring in Visual Communication Design and Informatics. I started out
        100% sure I wanted to be a graphic designer, but I unexpectedly fell in
        love with web programming, too. Now, my dream is to work in the
        intersection between visual design and technology. If I’m able to make
        even one person’s more delightful through my creations, then I can be
        satisfied.
      </p>

        I am the Chief Design Officer for Smirk UW and am currently working on
        Design and Web Development for the Stoma Project in the Sensors, Energy,
        and Automation Laboratory.

        In my own time, I like to create illustrations of my favorite
        characters, record covers of my favorite songs, and dance in my room as
        I play my favorite playlist through my Bluetooth speaker. If I’m not on
        campus, you can most definitely find me at my favorite restaurant,
        Meesum Pastry, indulging in the nostalgic and comforting taste of
        Taiwanese cuisine.
